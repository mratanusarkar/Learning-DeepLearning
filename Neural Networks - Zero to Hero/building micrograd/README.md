# building micrograd

This portion of the repo is a self documentation of my learning process and experimentations with micrograd.

I tried to document my understanding and my way of looking at micrograd, hope this helps anyone who comes across this code. (most of which is of Karpathy's code :p)

I plan to implement/alter a few portions of the micrograd according to my taste.

Full credit goes to the awesome **Andrej Karpathy**!
